v.0.0.1-beta

![Images](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allansachsambia/TheBookOfTheDead/master/readme-splash.png)

A demo for a side scroller video game written in JavaScript.  This project is an experiment to see if some semblance of a playable video game can be built in JavaScript without the use of canvas.

## Limitations

Does not work on any mobile devices and plays very slowly on Safari.  Works best on Chrome.

## Controls

Click enter/return to start/restart the game.  Use the arrow keys to control motion and the up arrow key to enter doors.  Use the spacebar to kill enemies with a sword.
