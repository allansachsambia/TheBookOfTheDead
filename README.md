![Images](./readme-splash.png)

A demo for a side scroller video game written in JavaScript (without canvas).

## Plot

After hearing stories of the dead rising and crazy neurotic spiders, a courageous target girl from a local circus investigates a graveyard and a nearby creepy mansion.  This investigation ends with her crossing paths with Wendy the Worm Demon.

## Controls

Click enter/return to start/restart the game.  Use the arrow keys to control motion and the up arrow key to enter doors.  Use the spacebar to throw knives.

## Development

This project is a demo.  It may undergo major changes over the next few months(/years?).  I'm open to collaboration, fyi.  So far it's just me.
