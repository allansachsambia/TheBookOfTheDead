The Book of the Dead is a demo for a side scroller video game written in JavaScript.  This project is an experiment to see if a video game can be programmed in JavaScript using animated html elements instead of canvas.  At present this project is unavailable on touch screen devices and works best on Chrome and Firefox.

## Controls

Click enter/return to start/restart the game.  Use the arrow keys to control motion and the up arrow key to enter doors.  Use the spacebar to kill enemies with a sword.
